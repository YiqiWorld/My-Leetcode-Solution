# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- solution: I used union for different situations 
select product_id, new_price as price
from Products
where (product_id, change_date) in 
(select product_id, max(change_date) from Products where change_date <= '2019-08-16' group by 1) 
union
select product_id, 10 as price 
from Products
group by 1
having min(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
