# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- solution 1: I used common table expression

with cte as
(select from_id as person1, to_id as person2,duration 
from Calls 
union all 
select to_id as person1, from_id as person2, duration
from Calls)

select person1, person2, count(*) as call_count, sum(duration) as total_duration
from cte 
where person1 < person2
group by 1,2


-- solution 2: I used case 

select
case 
when from_id < to_id then from_id 
else to_id 
end as person1,
case
when from_id > to_id then from_id 
else to_id 
end as person2,
count(*) as call_count, 
sum(duration) as total_duration
from Calls
group by 1,2

-- solution 3: I used least() and greatest() 
select least(from_id, to_id) as person1, greatest(from_id, to_id) as person2, count(*) as call_count, sum(duration) as total_duration 
from Calls 
group by 1,2
